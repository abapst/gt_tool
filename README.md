# GT_TOOL

A Matlab GUI that simplifies generating ground truth from videos or lists of images. The interface is designed to reduce misery as much as possible and increase throughput. You use the mouse to place rough boxes around objects of interest, then use the keyboard to browse boxes and frames, finetune box boundaries, and add labels.

## Dependencies:
